# Recursive-Git-Pull-Script  
Easy script to update an entire folder of git repos  

Simply put the ps1 file in the folder you want to recursively update and run it  
To be more specific put it in the root dir of the git folders (above them) or it wont work  
This was made for my powercord plugins folder
